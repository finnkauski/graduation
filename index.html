					<h3>My project</h3><br />
					<ul>
						<li><p><b>Graduated October 2017</b></p></li>
						<li><p>The project was trying to create a mechanism by which to match hand-collected grocery item descriptions
							with webscraped data on groceries.</p></li>
						<li><p>Can we compare the prices of what we collect with what is available online?</p></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>slide structure shamelessly stolen from alexander drake. and some bits and pieces will be reused.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>My project</h3><br />
					<ul>
						<li><p>My solution was a tool that showed people a prediction of a matching pair of items, and asked a human to say `yes` or `no`.</p></li>
						<li><p>Eventually it would retrain itself and hopefully provide better matches.</p></li>
						<li><p>A Neural Network assisted matching tool</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Sounds fancy huh?</h4><br />
					<h3 class="fragment fade-in">It did, until I looked back at it last week <br /> üòÇüòÇ</h3><br />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>My project</h3><br />
					<ul>
						<li><p>I've learned so much since then and I'm sure you look back at some things you've worked on and see where you can improve.</p></li>
						<li><p>So much has changed in my department as more and more the whole DataScience‚Ñ¢ mentality set in.</p></li>
						<li><p>And without sounding too self-centered, I feel like my work on promoting python and really helped adoption.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What next?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Find small projects!</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Find small things in your immediate workspace and personal that you could automate!</p></li>
						<li><p>Scout out areas in your department that you could help with</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Someone struggling to make charts and production reports each month?</h3>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Someone needs to replicate an old system in a reproducible and flexible way?</h3>
					<img class="smaller borderless fragment fade-in" src="http://www.stickpng.com/assets/images/5848152fcef1014c0b5e4967.png" alt="" />
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>But it's not DataScience‚Ñ¢!</h3>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">Maybe not, but if people are worried about these things they won't ask the deeper questions about their data
					which is where all the fancy machine learning could come in.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">Take advantage of stuff you can practice on! It's both business relevant <b>and</b> good practice!</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						In the end you have to all this stuff in data science projects anyway. Might as well practice!
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>You forge how others perceive you!</h3>
					<blockquote class="fragment fade-in">`oh you're the python/R person within my immediate surroundings and you've shown you can solve my problems`</blockquote>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">Once that is true, work will come and it will become a self reinforcing cycle!</p>
					<small class="fragment fade-in">Basically getting paid to learn</small>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Keep learning!</h3>
					<p>Not everyone will. </p>
					<p>Not everyone who comes out the DSA will still have the desire
						to keep pursuing a career in this field.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Keep learning!</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><p>But if you do want to learn and continue down the rabbithole, ask for development time!</p></li>
						<li><p>One, two, three hours per week will do you wonders.</p></li>
						<li><p>Don't get distracted (maybe try pomodoro, google it)</p></li>
						<li><p>And make sure to find an outlet where to apply these skills</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Last point is important! You won't get leverage to do development without showing that its useful.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ol>
							<li>Not everyone will get the chance to do 1.</li>
						</ol>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>My summarised resource page</h3>
					<p>I'm sure you can shove this into google, hence no links <br />(past me was lazy).</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>DataCamp, Coursera, Udemy</p></li>
						<li><p>Hands On Machine Learning with Sci Kit learn and Tensorflow</p></li>
						<li><p>Books in general, Blogs</p></li>
						<li><p>Take as much as you can from the lovely GovDataScience Slack community</p></li>
						<li><p>Honestly, drop me a slack message if you need more info or advice.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>More formally...</h3>
					<p>If you've decided to take it more formally please contact datasciencecampus@ons.gov.uk</p>
					<p>We offer apprenticeships, in-house training and a masters in <br /> "Data Analystics for Government"</p>
					<p>There is much more to on offer in terms of support. Make sure to contact us for more information.</p>

					<p>note: if someone wants to join me and do a little extracurricular club, go for it!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>I am not advocating you going out of your way and working at home on things that you have to do at work.</p>
					<p>But if you have genuine curiosity, foster it and keep doing mini projects at home. That will pay off!</p>

					<h3>Imagine a world without failure</h3>
					<p>I worked in Prices division of ONS</p>
					<p>The Consumer Prices Index is non-revisable</p>
					<p>That is a situation where we CAN NOT fail</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Imagine a world without failure</h3>
					<p>As soon as you come around with any new idea you get questions about how reliable it is</p>
					<p>It becomes hard to push through anything experimental</p>
					<p>But not impossible</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Imagine a world without failure</h3>
					<p>Change will be incremental, but you have to once again show how useful the things you learn are</p>
					<p>And more importantly you need to establish a culture of acceptance surrounding unsuccessful projects</p>
					<p>Where it is acceptable ofcourse!</p>
