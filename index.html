					<h3>My project</h3><br />
					<ul>
						<li><p><b>Graduated October 2017</b></p></li>
						<li><p>The project was trying to create a mechanism by which to match hand-collected grocery item descriptions
							with webscraped data on groceries.</p></li>
						<li><p>Can we compare the prices of what we collect with what is available online?</p></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>slide structure shamelessly stolen from alexander drake. and some bits and pieces will be reused.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>My project</h3><br />
					<ul>
						<li><p>My solution was a tool that showed people a prediction of a matching pair of items, and asked a human to say `yes` or `no`.</p></li>
						<li><p>Eventually it would retrain itself and hopefully provide better matches.</p></li>
						<li><p>A Neural Network assisted matching tool</p></li>
					</ul>

					<h4>I thought I did a good job</h4><br />

				<section>
					<h3>My project</h3><br />
					<ul>
						<li><p>I've learned so much since then and I'm sure you look back at some things you've worked on and see where you can improve.</p></li>
						<li><p>So much has changed in my department as more and more the whole Data Science‚Ñ¢ mentality set in.</p></li>
						<li><p>And without sounding too self-centered, I feel like my work on promoting python and really helped adoption.</p></li>
					</ul>

					<h2>What next?</h2>

					<h3>Find small projects!</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Find small things in your immediate workspace and personal life that you could automate! (<a href="https://a-bandn.herokuapp.com">webapp</a>, photocompetition etc.)</p></li>
						<li><p>Scout out areas in your department that you could help with</p></li>

					<h3>But it's not Data Science‚Ñ¢!</h3>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">Maybe not, but if people are worried about these things they won't ask the deeper questions about their data
					which is where all the fancy machine learning could come in. We're building a foundation!</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">Take advantage of of these things! It's both business relevant <b>and</b> good practice!</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						How many of you spent a large amount of your projects on things like data wrangling?
						In the end you have to all this stuff in data science projects anyway. Might as well practice!

					<p>Not everyone will. </p>
					<p>Not everyone who comes out the DSA will still have the desire

				<section>
					<h3>Keep learning!</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><p>But if you do want to learn and continue down the rabbithole, ask for development time!</p></li>
						<li><p>One, two, three hours per week will do you wonders.</p></li>
						<li><p>Don't get distracted (maybe try pomodoro, google it)</p></li>
						<li><p>And make sure to find an outlet where to apply these skills</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Last point is important! You won't get leverage to do development without showing that its useful.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ol>
							<li>not everyone will get the chance to do 1.</li>

					<h3>My summarised resource page (python biased)</h3>
					<p>I'm sure you can shove this into google, hence no links <br />(past me was lazy).</p>

						<li><p>DataCamp, Coursera, Udemy, pydata, pycon </p></li>
						<li><p>Hands On Machine Learning with Sci Kit learn and Tensorflow</p></li>
						<li><p>Books in general, Blogs, RealPython (awesome webpage <3)</p></li>
						<li><p>Take as much as you can from the lovely GovDataScience Slack community</p></li>
						<li><p>Talks by James Powell are always fun</p></li>
						<li><p>Honestly, drop me a slack message if you need more info or advice. (@art_dsc)</p></li>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>ask me anything, how did you do this presentation? </p>

					<h3>More formally...</h3>
					<p>If you've decided to take it more formally please contact the <br /> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/gds-academy">GDS Academy</a> or <a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/"> datasciencecampus@ons.gov.uk</a></p>
					<p>We offer apprenticeships, in-house training and a masters in <br /> "Data Analytics for Government"</p>
					<p>There is much more on offer in terms of support. Make sure to contact us for more information.</p>

					<h3>Case study 1</h3>
					<p>Katie Davidson was on first cohort of Accelerator at GDS.</p>
					<p>Campus then sponsored her to do a part-time MSc in Data Science at Birkbeck, and she returned to accelerator as a mentor.</p>
					<p>While studying she was promoted to Head of Data Science at Dept of Health and Social Care and set up her own data science team.</p>

					<h3>Case study 2</h3>
					<p>Bharath Vadhoola was on the last cohort I mentored for this programme.</p>
					<p>He looked at predicting pheonix companies</p>
					<p>He was offered the role of principal Data Science at the Home Office</p>

						<p>Come in at around 10, leave 18:30 - 19:00 ish</p>
						<p>It helps me not being at home. I am more productive.</p>

				<section>
					<p>I am not advocating you going out of your way and working at home on things that you have to do at work.</p>
					<p>But if you have genuine curiosity, foster it and keep doing mini projects at home. That will pay off!</p>

					<h3>How I stopped worrying and learned to love the fail.</h3>
					<p>As soon as you come around with any new idea you get questions about how reliable it is</p>
					<p>It becomes hard to push through anything experimental</p>
					<p>But not impossible!</p>
					<p>It's a test of character</p>
					<p>Earn the trust of others in doing things in a new way...</p>

					<p class="fragment fade-in">Who has used git for their DSA project?</p>
					<ol class="fragment fade-in">
						<li><p>Learn how to structure projects (regardless of language)</p></li>

						<li><p>Make all your projects tidy and easy to use</p></li>
						<li><p>Document your projects</p></li>
						<li><p>Host all of it on github</p></li>
